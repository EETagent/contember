 * for each node, causing React to unmount and re-mount our components, which completely ruins them. If we do the
 * opposite though, that is preserve the reference, Slate bails out of re-rendering our blocks. To circumvent
 * the latter, we introduce this context in order to notify all contember blocks about the update. That way they can
 * stay referentially equal but still re-render. The value itself does not matter â€’ it is just something we can easily
 * change between renders.
