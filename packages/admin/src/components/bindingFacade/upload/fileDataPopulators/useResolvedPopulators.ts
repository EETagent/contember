// This is an unfortunate situation. If we put the entire props into the dependency array, we get too many
// re-initializations, which would cause more problems down the line (it would recompute even for completely unrelated
// props changes). If, on the other hand, we name the individual props, as we do below, TypeScript somewhat rightfully
// complains that we're accessing random props (the dependency array gets evaluated before any type narrowing can take
// place). Hence the cast and the eslint disabling.
// We could avoid this at the expense of code duplication (we also need resolvePopulators as a separate function)
// but the current solution seems like a better trade-off â€’ I absolutely suck at keeping duplicate pieces of code in sync.
